map_info_text=Welcome to Moutain Defenes!\n\nMany years after the launch of the rocket, biters made a comeback and wiped out most of the human cities. You and the other survivors have built the last bastion of humanity. Unfortunately, biters have found us. They are organizing troops to march towards us. Before biters destroy the base, launch rockets to escape from this place!\nTips:\n1. You can use RPG button to enhance yourself.\n2. In the RPG settings panel, you can enable magic and select your spells.\n3. RPG magic can increase your luck\n4. You can buy vehicles in the main market. They have internal space.\n6. The blue box in the car transfers items in from car trunk, when the option to take from buffer chest is enabled.\n5. Launching rockets will give a lot of rewards, and the more you launch, the more rewards you get.\nAuthor: ITAM\nThanks: Hanakocz
